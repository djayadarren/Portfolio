      <h3>Self-Balancing Robot</h3>
      <p>
        A project that brought together control theory, embedded systems, and (a lot of) fine-tuning.
        This is a two-wheeled robot that balances itself in real time using a PID controller and IMU data. 
        The control loop is tuned through hands-on testing to get it stable, responsive, and surprisingly agile. 
        The robot also includes edge detection with a time-of-flight sensor, object detection using a compact camera, and Bluetooth connectivity for wireless control and feedback.

      <h3>Snake Game</h3>
      <p>
        A simple snake game built in Python using Tkinter. It features a custom GUI with animated menus, real-time canvas rendering, and smooth input handling via after() callbacks. 
        Players can select snake colors and difficulty before starting the game, which includes dynamic effects like wavy snake motion and pulsing food. 
        The game is organized as a little object-oriented programming project, using class-based structure for clear separation of logic, UI, and animation timing.

      <h3>Metal Detecting Robot</h3>
      <p>
        This is a remote-controlled robot that detects metal objects using a custom coil sensor. 
        The robot communicates with a wireless controller over a master-slave connection, allowing for real-time feedback and control.
        Debugging the communication between the controller and the robot was the most challenging part â€” the robot kept wandering off due to noisy signals until we refined the timing and input handling. 
        Now it reliably scans for metal while responding smoothly to user commands along with a handful of other cool features.
