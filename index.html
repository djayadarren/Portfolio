      <h3>Self-Balancing Robot</h3>
      <p>
        A project that brought together control theory, embedded systems, and (a lot of) fine-tuning.
        This is our two-wheeled robot that balances itself in real time using a PID controller and IMU data. 
        We tuned the control loop through hands-on testing to get it stable, responsive, and surprisingly agile. 
        The robot also includes edge detection with a time-of-flight sensor, object detection using a compact camera, and Bluetooth connectivity for wireless control and feedback.

      <h3>Metal Detecting Robot</h3>
      <p>
        This is our remote-controlled robot that detects metal objects using a custom coil sensor. 
        The robot communicates with a wireless controller over a master-slave connection, allowing for real-time feedback and control.
        Debugging the communication between the controller and the robot was the most challenging part â€” the robot kept wandering off due to noisy signals until we refined the timing and input handling. 
        Now it reliably scans for metal while responding smoothly to user commands along with a handful of other cool features.
